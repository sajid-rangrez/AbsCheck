"18335846","false","Ibuprofen was the first non-aspirin non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) to be approved for over-the-counter (OTC) use and is widely considered to be the best tolerated drug of its class. Low-dose, OTC ibuprofen has been used for pain relief for over 30 years without any obvious major health issues. However, there is no clear differentiation between the OTC and prescription doses of ibuprofen, and their respective effects. Adverse reactions to ibuprofen appear to be dose and duration dependent, and this may be the reason for the observed tolerability of the drug at OTC doses. OTC ibuprofen is at least as effective as aspirin and more effective than paracetamol. The tolerability concerns associated with higher dose NSAIDs currently do not apply to low-dose, short-term use of ibuprofen for common pain. Ibuprofen is associated with the least risk of GI complications compared with other NSAIDs and is considered relatively benign in overdose. This review will aim to distinguish the safety of OTC or non-prescription use of ibuprofen from its prescription use.",

Concern about the role of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and, in particular, ibuprofen has led to significant speculation.<b>Areas covered</b>: A literature search was conducted to evaluate ibuprofen's potential benefits and harms in the COVID-19 disease. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is crucial entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in host cells. We found no scientific evidence linking ibuprofen use and an ACE-2 overexpression. Ibuprofen suppresses the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in the 'cytokine storm' and subsequent ARDS in COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, the exact role of ibuprofen in the immune response in COVID-19 disease is still unknown. There are no double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the effect of ibuprofen on COVID-19 disease progression.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The studies that have been performed so far demonstrate no association between ibuprofen use and increased mortality rates or an increased risk for respiratory support.

These results provide an additional explanation for the previously observed therapeutic effects of ibuprofen in CF patients and further strengthen the argument for its use by these patients.","Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of ibuprofen therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, an effect that is currently attributed to ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, a few previous reports demonstrated an antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen as well, although none investigated its direct effects on the pathogens found in the CF lung, which is the focus of this work. Determination of ibuprofen's <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia</i> species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an <i>in vitro</i><i>Pseudomonas</i> biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute <i>Pseudomonas</i> pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile. Ibu-NPs formulated for aerosol delivery inhibited the growth of <i>P. aeruginosa in vitro</i> and may provide a convenient dosing method. These results provide an additional explanation for the previously observed therapeutic effects of ibuprofen in CF patients and further strengthen the argument for its use by these patients."
"36903343","false","The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen is considered to be an emerging contaminant because of its presence in different environments (from water bodies to soils) at concentrations with adverse effects on aquatic organisms due to cytotoxic and genotoxic damage, high oxidative cell stress, and detrimental effects on growth, reproduction, and behavior. Because of its high human consumption rate and low environmental degradation rate, ibuprofen represents an emerging environmental problem. Ibuprofen enters the environment from different sources and accumulates in natural environmental matrices. The problem of drugs, particularly ibuprofen, as contaminants is complicated because few strategies consider them or apply successful technologies to remove them in a controlled and efficient manner. In several countries, ibuprofen's entry into the environment is an unattended contamination problem. It is a concern for our environmental health system that requires more attention. Due to its physicochemical characteristics, ibuprofen degradation is difficult in the environment or by microorganisms. There are experimental studies that are currently focused on the problem of drugs as potential environmental contaminants. However, these studies are insufficient to address this ecological issue worldwide. This review focuses on deepening and updating the information concerning ibuprofen as a potential emerging environmental contaminant and the potential for using bacteria for its biodegradation as an alternative technology.",
"23163543","false","The discovery of ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory activity by Dr (now Professor) Stewart Adams and colleagues (Boots Pure Chemical Company Ltd, Nottingham, UK) 50 years ago represented a milestone in the development of anti-inflammatory analgesics. Subsequent clinical studies were the basis for ibuprofen being widely accepted for treating painful conditions at high anti-rheumatic doses (≤ 2400 mg/d), with lower doses (≤ 1200 mg/d for ≤ 10 days) for mild-moderate acute pain (e.g. dental pain, headache, dysmenorrhoea, respiratory symptoms and acute injury). The early observations have since been verified in studies comparing ibuprofen with newer cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors ('coxibs'), paracetamol and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The use of the low-dose, non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drug was based on marketing approval in 1983 (UK) and 1984 (USA); and it is now available in over 80 countries. The relative safety of OTC ibuprofen has been supported by large-scale controlled studies. It has the same low gastro-intestinal (GI) effects as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and fewer GI effects than aspirin. Ibuprofen is a racemate. Its physicochemical properties and the short plasma-elimination half-life of the R(-) isomer, together with its limited ability to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and thus prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, compared with that of S(+)-ibuprofen, are responsible for the relatively low GI toxicity. The R(-) isomer is then converted in the body to the S(+) isomer after absorption in the GI tract. Ex vivo inhibition of COX-1 (thromboxane A(2)) and COX-2 (PGE(2)) at the plasma concentrations of S(+)-ibuprofen corresponding to those found in the plasma following ingestion of 400 mg ibuprofen in dental and other inflammatory pain models provides evidence of the anti-inflammatory mechanism at OTC dosages. R(-)-ibuprofen has effects on leucocytes, suggesting that ibuprofen has anti-leucocyte effects, which underlie its anti-inflammatory actions. Future developments include novel gastro-tolerant forms for 'at risk' patients, and uses in the prevention of neuro-inflammatory states and cancers.",
"391117","false","Ibuprofen was introduced in England in 1967 and in the United States in 1974 as an anti-inflammatory drug in humans. It has weak but definite anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of aspirin, milligram for milligram, but with considerably less adverse effect on the stomach. Ibuprofen is chemically related to fenoprofen and naproxen, but lack of effect for any one in this chemical class of propionic-acid derivatives does not necessarily mean lack of effect for any other in an individual patient. The drug has analgesic properties, probably related to its anti-inflammatory effect. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has no effect on the adrenopituitary axis, making it a nonsteroidal agent. Ibuprofen has been shown to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is probably effective in ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and Bartter's syndrome.",
"12517240","false","Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the over-the-counter analgesics that is used frequently for the self-management of some of the common disorders. There seems to be two types of relations between paracetamol and asthma - paracetamol intolerance leading to bronchospasm in analgesic-induced asthmatics; and the relation between asthma and the amount and frequency of consumption of paracetamol. Paracetamol is generally recommended as one of the safer analgesics in both analgesic tolerant and intolerant asthmatics, without the fear of severe bronchospasm that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can induce in these patients. However, Paracetamol is reported to cross-react with aspirin at a rate of approximately 20-30% in a dose-dependent way. Therefore, it should not be recommended to analgesic intolerant asthmatics, without performing oral provocation tests to prove its safety. The possible association between the amount and frequency of paracetamol consumption and the prevalence and degree of asthma as suggested by some of the recent surveys, needs to be investigated further.",

"3552585","false","Since their synthesis in the late 1800s paracetamol (acetaminophen) and phenacetin have followed divergent pathways with regard to their popularity as mild analgesic/antipyretic drugs. Initially, paracetamol was discarded in favour of phenacetin because the latter drug was supposedly less toxic. Today the opposite is true, and paracetamol, along with aspirin, has become one of the two most popular 'over-the-counter' non-narcotic analgesic agents. This marked increase in the wide approval attained by paracetamol has been accompanied by the virtual commercial demise of phenacetin because of its role, albeit somewhat circumstantial, in causing analgesic nephropathy. Both paracetamol and phenacetin are effective mild analgesics, suitable for treating mild to moderate pain, and their actions are broadly comparable with those of aspirin and related salicylates, although they do not appear to possess significant anti-inflammatory activity. Since a major portion of a dose of phenacetin is rapidly metabolised to paracetamol, it seems possible that phenacetin owes some of its therapeutic activity to its main metabolite, paracetamol, whereas its most troublesome side effect (methaemoglobinaemia) is due to another metabolite, p-phenetidine. The mechanism of action of paracetamol is poorly defined, although it has been speculated that it may selectively inhibit prostaglandin production in the central nervous system, which would account for its analgesic/antipyretic properties. The lack of any significant influence on peripheral cyclooxygenase would explain the absence of anti-inflammatory activity. At therapeutic doses paracetamol is well tolerated and produces fewer side effects than aspirin. The most frequently reported adverse effect associated with paracetamol is hepatotoxicity, which occurs after acute overdosage (usually doses greater than 10 to 15g are needed) and, very rarely, during long term treatment with doses at the higher levels of the therapeutic range. Paracetamol damages the liver through the formation of a highly reactive metabolite which is normally inactivated by conjugation with glutathione. Overdoses of paracetamol exhaust glutathione stores, thus allowing the accumulation of this toxic metabolite which covalently binds with vital cell elements and can result in liver necrosis. Glutathione precursors (notably intravenous N-acetylcysteine) have proved remarkably successful in treating paracetamol overdose, as long as treatment is initiated within 10 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
"17227290","false","Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of the most popular and widely used drugs for the treatment of pain and fever. It occupies a unique position among analgesic drugs. Unlike NSAIDs it is almost unanimously considered to have no antiinflammatory activity and does not produce gastrointestinal damage or untoward cardiorenal effects. Unlike opiates it is almost ineffective in intense pain and has no depressant effect on respiration. Although paracetamol has been used clinically for more than a century, its mode of action has been a mystery until about one year ago, when two independent groups (Zygmunt and colleagues and Bertolini and colleagues) produced experimental data unequivocally demonstrating that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is due to the indirect activation of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors. In brain and spinal cord, paracetamol, following deacetylation to its primary amine (p-aminophenol), is conjugated with arachidonic acid to form N-arachidonoylphenolamine, a compound already known (AM404) as an endogenous cannabinoid. The involved enzyme is fatty acid amide hydrolase. N-arachidonoylphenolamine is an agonist at TRPV1 receptors and an inhibitor of cellular anandamide uptake, which leads to increased levels of endogenous cannabinoids; moreover, it inhibits cyclooxygenases in the brain, albeit at concentrations that are probably not attainable with analgesic doses of paracetamol. CB(1) receptor antagonist, at a dose level that completely prevents the analgesic activity of a selective CB(1) receptor agonist, completely prevents the analgesic activity of paracetamol. Thus, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug, the active one being a cannabinoid. These findings finally explain the mechanism of action of paracetamol and the peculiarity of its effects, including the behavioral ones. Curiously, just when the first CB(1) agonists are being introduced for pain treatment, it comes out that an indirect cannabino-mimetic had been extensively used (and sometimes overused) for more than a century.",
"26460177","false","Although 60 years have passed since it became widely available on the therapeutic market, paracetamol dosage in patients with liver disease remains a controversial subject. Fulminant hepatic failure has been a well documented consequence of paracetamol overdose since its introduction, while short and long term use have both been associated with elevation of liver transaminases, a surrogate marker for acute liver injury. From these reports it has been assumed that paracetamol use should be restricted or the dosage reduced in patients with chronic liver disease. We review the factors that have been purported to increase risk of hepatocellular injury from paracetamol and the pharmacokinetic alterations in different pathologies of chronic liver disease which may affect this risk. We postulate that inadvertent under-dosing may result in concentrations too low to enable efficacy. Specific research to improve the evidence base for prescribing paracetamol in patients with different aetiologies of chronic liver disease is needed.",

Personal contacts existed to renowned researchers having contributed to the medical use of paracetamol and its precursors as H.U. Zollinger, S. Moeschlin, U. Dubach, J. Axelrod and others. Further information is found in earlier reviews by Eichengrün, Rodnan and Benedek, Sneader, Brune; comp. references.

"7039926","false","In therapeutic doses paracetamol is a safe analgesic, but in overdosage it can cause severe hepatic necrosis. Following oral administration it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, its systemic bioavailability being dose-dependent and ranging from 70 to 90%. Its rate of oral absorption is predominantly dependent on the rate of gastric emptying, being delayed by food, propantheline, pethidine and diamorphine and enhanced by metoclopramide. Paracetamol is also well absorbed from the rectum. It distributes rapidly and evenly throughout most tissues and fluids and has a volume of distribution of approximately 0.9L/kg. 10 to 20% of the drug is bound to red blood cells. Paracetamol is extensively metabolised (predominantly in the liver), the major metabolites being the sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. A minor fraction of drug is converted to a highly reactive alkylating metabolite which is inactivated with reduced glutathione and excreted in the urine as cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. Large doses of paracetamol (overdoses) cause acute hepatic necrosis as a result of depletion of glutathione and of binding of the excess reactive metabolite to vital cell constituents. This damage can be prevented by the early administration of sulfhydryl compounds such as methionine and N-acetylcysteine. In healthy subjects 85 to 95% of a therapeutic dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours with about 4, 55, 30, 4 and 4% appearing as unchanged paracetamol and its glucuronide, sulphate, mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates, respectively. The plasma half-life in such subjects ranges from 1.9 to 2.5 hours and the total body clearance from 4.5 to 5.5 ml/kg/min. Age has little effect on the plasma half-life, which is shortened in patients taking anticonvulsants. The plasma half-life is usually normal in patients with mild chronic liver disease, but its prolonged in those with decompensated liver disease.",

This case report highlights the need for early diagnosis and the feasibility of shorter-duration treatment for EPTB in developing countries.PRESENTATION:This case report describes a 19-year-old male from Southeast Asia who had a history of bronchiectasis involving the left lower lobe and the right middle lobe, which was cystic in nature, as well as multiple episodes of non-tuberculous pneumonia. Currently, he presented with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and acute kidney injury. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and moderate pericardial effusion. Early signs of cardiac tamponade were noted, specifically the absence of respiratory variation in the right ventricle and left ventricle collapse. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed, and hemorrhagic pericardial fluid was aspirated. Fluid analysis revealed high levels of LDH (5000 U/L), polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, and acid-fast bacilli that were visualized on microscopy, which led to the diagnosis of pericardial tuberculosis. A CT of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and polyserositis. Empirically, antitubercular therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was administered for 2 months and isoniazid along with rifampicin was given for the next 4 months. Serial echocardiograms in the following months showed an improvement in LVEF (55%) and decreased effusion. However, during this treatment period, due to frequent episodes of pneumonia, the evaluation of immunodeficiency disorders was performed and revealed low levels of IgG (4.741 g/L), IgA (0.238 g/L), and IgM (0.098 g/L). He was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency disease and received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.CONCLUSION:This report emphasizes the timely identification of cardiac tamponade and the effective management of EPTB through a shorter-than-recommended course of antitubercular therapy, resulting in the alleviation of symptoms and better overall health outcomes.",""

It is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, characterized by symptoms such as fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and atypical lymphocytosis in adults. In the pediatric population, acute EBV infection is typically asymptomatic.  Acute cholecystitis, on the other hand, refers to acute inflammation within the gallbladder, typically due to the obstruction of the cystic duct secondary to gallstones. Patients will often present with right upper quadrant pain positive for Murphy sign, among other manifestations such as fever, fatigue, and jaundice. EBV and acute cholecystitis rarely coincide with one another. This abstract presents a comprehensive analysis of a clinical case that illustrates how an EBV infection obscured the clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis. This case underscores the necessity for a nuanced approach to the diagnosis, especially when the standard of care diagnostic criteria become inconclusive. However, hepatocellular injury as a result of EBV infection is rare. In this case report, we present the case of a 19-year-old male who developed EBV-induced hepatitis, emphasizing the importance of considering EBV as a potential cause in similar clinical scenarios.",

"38225276","false","Bacterial T cell superantigens (SAgs) are a family of microbial exotoxins that function to activate large numbers of T cells simultaneously. SAgs activate T cells by direct binding and crosslinking of the lateral regions of MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells with T cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells; these interactions alter the normal TCR-peptide-MHC class II architecture to activate T cells in a manner that is independent of the antigen specificity of the TCR. SAgs have well-recognized, central roles in human diseases such as toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever through their quantitative effects on the T cell response; in addition, numerous other consequences of SAg-driven T cell activation are now being recognized, including direct roles in the pathogenesis of endocarditis, bloodstream infections, skin disease and pharyngitis. In this Review, we summarize the expanding family of bacterial SAgs and how these toxins can engage highly diverse adaptive immune receptors. We highlight recent findings regarding how SAg-driven manipulation of the adaptive immune response may operate in multiple human diseases, as well as contributing to the biology and life cycle of SAg-producing bacterial pathogens.",

These injuries caries a great burden on the patients, physicians and the health care systems and sometime are life-threatening. IBDIs are associated with different manifestations that are not limited to abdominal pain, bile leaks from the surgical drains, peritonitis with fever and sometimes jaundice. Such injuries if not witnessed during the surgery, can be diagnosed by combining clinical manifestations, biochemical tests and imaging techniques. Among such techniques abdominal US is usually the first choice while Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-Pancreatography seems the most appropriate. Surgical approach was the ideal approach for such cases, however the introduction of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) was a paradigm shift in the management of such injuries due to accepted success rates, lower cost and lower rates of associated morbidity and mortality. However, the literature lacks consensus for the optimal timing of ERCP intervention in the management of IBDIs. ERCP management of IBDIs can be tailored according to the nature of the underlying injury. For the subgroup of patients with complete bile duct ligation and lost ductal continuity, transfer to surgery is indicated without delay. Those patients will not benefit from endoscopy and hence should not do unnecessary ERCP. For low-flow leaks <i>e.g.</i> gallbladder bed leaks, conservative management for 1-2 wk prior to ERCP is advised, in contrary to high-flow leaks <i>e.g.</i> cystic duct leaks and stricture lesions in whom early ERCP is encouraged.

"38222745","true","BACKGROUND:Ecthyma contagiosum, sometimes referred to as human orf, is a zoonotic disease caused by the orf virus that is mostly acquired by coming into contact with diseased animals such as sheep or goats. The orf virus, a DNA virus belonging to the Poxviridae family, infects epidermal keratinocytes via breaking down the skin barrier, which can be caused by burns or wounds. The accompanying characteristic skin lesions can take on a range of morphologies depending on the infection's stage; lesions that are crusted, papillomatous, maculopapular, targetoid, and nodular can occur before clearing up. In addition to the lips and corners of the mouth, infected animals may also have lesions on the neck, vulva, and teeth. Skin sores caused by Ecthyma contagiousum discharge the orf virus into the environment.CASE PRESENTATION:A 4-month-old male infant with no medical history brought himself to the dermatology clinic with a minor fever and a skin lesion on his nose. An orf virus infection was discovered in the newborn through blood culture and PCR testing. For a subsequent infection, the patient received fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic, and an antipyretic. Following a follow-up of 3 months, the lesion vanished entirely.CONCLUSION:Rarely, as in our instance, are orf nodules seen somewhere else than the hands. In order to appropriately treat a patient without fear, clinicians should keep this in mind, especially if they come up with a history similar to that of our patient.",""

This predictive approach aims to guide insecticide usage and the management of pyrethroid resistance in the field populations of Ae. aegypti in Taiwan.","Aedes aegypti, the primary vector responsible for transmitting dengue fever in southern Taiwan, has developed a relatively high resistance to synthetic pyrethroids. It has evolved four amino acid substitutions in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), namely S996P, V1023G, F1565C, and D1794Y. To unveil the distribution and correlation of VGSC mutations and pyrethroid resistance among different field populations, Ae. aegypti collected from various districts in Kaohsiung and Tainan Cities underwent tests for resistance development against different pyrethroids and frequency of S996P, V1023G, F1565C, and D1794Y substitutions. The adult knockdown assay revealed a relatively high knockdown resistance in the Ae. aegypti populations from Kaohsiung and Tainan against permethrin, cypermethrin, and fenvalerate (averaging >50-fold). Conversely, less resistance was observed against α-cypermethrin, deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, and etofenprox (averaging <35-fold). Using Polymerase Chain Reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, four mutant haplotypes were identified in these field populations. Notably, the S<sub>IA</sub>VFD and S<sub>IB</sub>VFD wild haplotypes were absent. Analysis utilizing IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient indicated that Haplotype C (P<sub>IA</sub>GFD), especially P allele, frequency displayed a significant positive correlation with five Type II pyrethroid resistance, while 1023G and 1023G/G exhibited a significant association with permethrin and fevalerate resistance. Conversely, Haplotype E (S<sub>IB</sub>VCD) negatively correlated with pyrethroid resistance, particularly fenvalerate resistance (-0.776). Haplotype C and E were the most prevalent and widely distributed among the investigated field populations. This prevalence of haplotype C is likely tied to the extensive and excessive use of Type II pyrethroids for dengue control over the past three decades. Given the significant positive correlation, the best-fit lines and R<sup>2</sup> values were established to facilitate the swift prediction of knockdown resistance levels to various pyrethroids based on VGSC mutation frequency.
